# Analysis of Correlations between Human Development Index and IQ scores
*This is a project for Class Data Analysis at Central European University, taught on Bachelor Level by Elisa Omodei*  
---

This Anylsis investigates the correnation between the Human Development Index (HDI), a measure of a countries achievements in the field of human development, and countries average IQ score, an meaure of indivduals analytic intelligence. The Project in detail examines the variables interplay on a country level as well as on regional levels utiliting univeriate and bivariate technices, with focus on exploring the following Hypotheses:
1.	The average IQ and Human Development Index are positively correlated on a Country Level.
2.	Less developed regions are more prune to outliers.
3.	The IQ is biased towards western countries.
## Analysis Design
The project aims to answer the Hypotheses, and is strucured as follows:
1.	Cleaning, Preperationg and Merging
2.	Univariate for HDI and IQ Data seperatly
On country and regional level
3.	Bivariate Anylsis for HDI and IQ
## What the results can be used for
Firstly, the findings can be used to show that IQ is biased towards western country, which could be used to readjust the measurement norm in a way to reduce the bias, 
Secondly, legislators can use the result to evaluate their country's IQ performance relative to others with similar HDI-Socres or within their respective region. The can furher use these findings to readjust their strategies in terms of edcucation and other human development indicators that could have an infulence in IQ in the long-term.
## Note on Causaltiy
This project is an analysis of correlation not causaility. We believe that the causailty is that some components of the HDI are having a causal mechanism towards countries average IQ, and are keen to highlight that we donâ€™t believe there is causality in the reversed direction.
